# Minecraft Emoji Mod
This mod gives you emoji intellisense/autocomplete for emojis in Minecraft. This lets you type emojis like how you would in Discord. Mod is fabric only and client-side.


I recommend you download [Andros Discord Emojis](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/andros-discord-emojis) because the default Minecraft emojis are stink.
